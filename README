Footscray Maker Lab
Access system

Weâ€™re just in the process of building and installing the rfid door lock system. 

Eventually we plan to have tools, lockers, and other resources use RFID reading, and to implement pay-to-use plans, and track your experience with tools to build upon your maker profile.
